#### Describe the Bug
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Summary:**
The smart contract fails to execute transaction reversals when conditions for reversal are met, leading to incorrect token balances.

#### Steps to Reproduce
To reproduce the behavior, follow these steps:

1. Deploy the contract using Remix with the following initial parameters...
2. Invoke `executeTransaction` with parameters `x`, `y`, `z`.
3. Call `checkBalance` for the involved accounts.
4. Notice that the balance has not updated according to the supposed reversal logic.

#### Expected Behavior
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Expected Outcome:**
When the transaction meets the reversal criteria, the balances of the involved accounts should revert to their state prior to the transaction.
